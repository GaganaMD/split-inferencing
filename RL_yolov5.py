# For demonstration, we'll assume a simplified way to access model layers.
# In a real scenario, you'd inspect the YOLOv5 model's architecture (model.yaml or by printing model)
# to understand its sequential layers and where a 'split point' would make sense.

# Load YOLOv5 model
# Make sure you have the YOLOv5 repository accessible or install it.
# !git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # Run this if you don't have it
# import sys
# sys.path.append('yolov5') # Add yolov5 to path if not installed as a package
# from models.common import Conv, C3 # Example of modules you might want to target

# For simplicity, we'll use the hub load which gives a torch.nn.Module
